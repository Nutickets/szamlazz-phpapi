This repo serves only as a light wrapper around the official [Szamlazz PHP API](https://docs.szamlazz.hu/#php-api), allowing it to be installed via composer.

Version: 2.10.17

The code remains "as is" from the official download, with the following exceptions:

- Updated to comply with PSR-4
- Introduced the composer.json
